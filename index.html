    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated lifelong learner and results-driven professional who pursues
        excellence one step at a time. I believe every challenge—whether a success or a
        setback—is a valuable opportunity to grow and innovate. Early in my academic
        career, my passion for research earned me first place in a statewide competition,
        and a key idea I introduced continues to shape ongoing projects. In my professional
        life, I proactively expand my expertise by taking targeted online courses and
        embracing every opportunity to advance my skills. Outside of work, my commitment
        to personal development is evident in my journey through martial arts—from 
        progressing as a student, to coaching kids and adults, to taking on leadership 
        responsibilities as an assistant manager. My diverse experiences, including
        managing a nursery side project, reflect my adaptability, drive to excel, and
        readiness to rise to any challenge.
